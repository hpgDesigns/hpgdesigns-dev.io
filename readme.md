## Welcome to the Enigma Wiki on Github.

As of this writing, the Enigma site was partially offline, therefore this repository was created as a backup. Feel free to use it as needed. 

Please note that this is a work in progress. You can download to your computer and use it just as if you were online.

You are also encouraged to update it as revisions are constantly being made to it. A simple command 'git pull' will update.

Special thanks goes out to developer **gfundies** for the script that made such a feat possible.
